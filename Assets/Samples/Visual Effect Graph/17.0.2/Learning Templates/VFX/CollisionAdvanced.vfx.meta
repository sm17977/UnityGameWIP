    description: "As VFX Graph is simulating particles on the GPU, they cannot collide
      with regular Rigid Body Colliders. But you can still make them collide with
      different geometry approximations like Boxes, Spheres, Cones, Planes or even
      complex shapes with the use of SDF and/or Depth Buffer. Sometimes using simple
      collision shapes isn\u2019t enough to get a precise enough collision with the
      environment. In this case, using SDF can be a good solution to approximate
      complex geometry like this sculpture of a hand."
