    description: "The pivot attribute control where the output render is instantiated
      in regard to the particle position. By default, the pivot is centered on the
      Particles\u2019s Position. But you can offset it on any axis (XYZ). Offsetting
      the pivot can be extremely helpful as it can lead to interesting motion when
      doing scaling or rotation."
