    description: Whether the Output is set to Quads, Meshes, or even Strips, we often
      want to control how to instantiate the geometry on a particle. Should it be
      facing the camera? What is the forward and/or Up-Axis ? The Orient Block helps
      us to easily orient our particles as it comes with a number of different modes.
      This example shows how to use the Fixed Axis mode.
