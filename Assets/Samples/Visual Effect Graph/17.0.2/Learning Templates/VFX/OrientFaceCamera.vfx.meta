    description: Whether the output is set to quads, meshes, or even strips, we often
      want to control how the geometry is instantiated on a particle. Should it face
      the camera? What is the forward and/or up-axis? The Orient Block helps us to
      easily orient our particles with its various modes. In this example, we're
      using the Face Camera Position mode, which will ensure that the particles are
      always facing the Camera position.
