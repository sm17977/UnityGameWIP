    description: 'Controlling the Pivot of a particle is a key aspect to unlock interesting
      motion. This VFX is giving an example of Pivot manipulation. Here the petals,
      Leafs and Spikes of the Flower are all particles. The Pivot attribute is controlled
      and sometimes animated to be able to properly locate and animate the particles.
      This example also demonstrates the ShaderGraph integration and how you can
      control ShaderGraph through VFX Graph. '
