    description: 'Decal is a very powerful tool that can add a lot of visual complexity
      to an environment. We can use decals to project textures on the environment
      and even on dynamic objects or skinned meshes. Output Decals allow you to render
      particles as decals and to project its properties onto a surface using a Base
      Color map (albedo), a Normal Map, or a Mask Map. This example shows how to
      leverage the Output Decal to stick and project animated decals onto an animated
      skinned mesh renderer. '
