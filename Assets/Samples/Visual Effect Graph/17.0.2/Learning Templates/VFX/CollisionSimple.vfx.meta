    description: As VFX Graph is simulating particles on the GPU, they cannot collide
      with regular Rigid Body Colliders. But you can still make them collide with
      different geometry approximations like Boxes, Spheres, Cones, Planes or even
      complex shapes with the use of SDF and/or Depth Buffer. This example shows
      you how to combine different collider blocks to get the desired results. It
      also covers some tricks to leverage boolean port to get rid of some collision
      precision issues.
