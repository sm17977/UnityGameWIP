    description: As VFX Graph is simulating particles on the GPU, they cannot collide
      with regular Rigid Body Colliders. But you can still make them collide with
      different geometry approximations like Boxes, Spheres, Cones, Planes or even
      complex shapes with the use of SDF and/or Depth Buffer. This VFX Graph, shows
      the use of a standard Collider Block and how the different Collision Properties
      like Bounce, Friction and/or Roughness can influence the collision response
      of the particles.
