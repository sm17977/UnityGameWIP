    category: Learning Templates
    description: 'A signed distance field (SDF) is a technique used to efficiently
      represent the shape and contours of 2D or 3D objects. It allows us to calculate
      the distance from any point in space to the nearest point on the object''s
      surface. This VFX demonstrates how to sample an SDF to have particles crawling
      on the surface of a mesh. '
