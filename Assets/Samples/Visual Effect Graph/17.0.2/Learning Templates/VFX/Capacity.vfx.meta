    description: 'Capacity Count is used for the particle Memory allocation of a
      system. Increasing this number will increase the memory allocated. This capacity
      can be seen as the max active particles.It''s a good practice to keep this
      number as close as possible to the Maximum alive particles.This VFX explains
      what capacity is and how to use the VFX Control to set the Capacity. '
